# Server Setup

## OpenTripPlanner

The app requires an [OpenTripPlanner](https://www.OpenTripPlanner.org/) server to function.

## Conventions

To display an agency name in the itinerary you, can provide a short name on the OpenTripPlanner server.
Make sure the agency field is formatted like this:

    Official Long Name [Short name]
